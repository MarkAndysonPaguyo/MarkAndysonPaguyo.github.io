    <h1>Re: Marie Andy Pags university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Marie,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of STI Information and Technology faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?pli=1#main_7">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>At the STI Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
      <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Philippine Exotic Food</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study Philippine Exotic Food. To answer your question, my favourite exotic food are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Isaw, Betamax, Gizzard</dt>
      <dd>This might just be the <i>mildest</i> among the rest of the items on this list. All of these three are grilled, and there are basically sold everywhere in the country, most especially in places near university belts. Isaw is chicken intestines, betamax is grilled blood cubes, and gizzard is basically grilled chicken gizzard. Other culture also eat innards, in fact there’s a couple of words pertaining to innards such as Giblet, for chicken neck, heart and liver, Numbles for animal entrails.</dd>
      <dt>Balut</dt>
      <dd>Evenings would never be complete without hearing some vendor calling out “baloooooooot!”. Some vendors walk, others would be in their bicycles. But did you ever try to buy one? If you haven’t and you’re wondering what it is, then it’s a duck egg. To be more specific, it’s a developed duck egg, which of course means that there’s a little baby duck inside it. It’s very popular among the locals. It has this bit of broth that has a distinct taste, and some egg yolk and hardened albumen. Some would put vinegar in it, others would just put a bit of salt.</dd>
      <dt>Betute Tugak (Deep fried stuffed frogs) Pampanga</dt>
      <dd>Fancy deep fried frogs with meat stuffings? They always say that frogs taste like chicken and they do. That in itself is comforting, just close your eyes and imagine you’re eating chicken if you’re having second thoughts on eating this. Betute Tugak is quite popular in Pampanga. These frogs are those that roam around farms during the rainy season. They’d remove the skin, season it with salt and pepper and stuff it with sautéed ground pork.</dd>
